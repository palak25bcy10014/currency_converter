# Currency_Converter-Introduction to Programming Project

##  📌Overview
This is a Python-based desktop application for currency conversion with GUI, designed to make life easier by avoiding the hassle of navigating through complex financial websites. The tool uses the ExchangeRate-API to provide real-time data and has a resilient architecture that embeds tkinter in the frontend, while the requests library is used for backend operations, ensuring functionality even without an internet connection through an intelligent offline caching system.

## 📌Features
 * Real-time data fetching:* Fetches real-time exchange rates for USD, INR, EUR, etc., using a live REST API.
 * Resilient Offline Mode:* Automatically switches to a fallback local dataset if network error conditions are detected.
 * Input Validation:*  Provides error handling for non-numeric inputs that prevents application crashes.
 * User-Friendly GUI:* Clean interface with drop-down menus for selecting currencies and clear results display.
 * Cross-Platform Compatibility:* Because it's Python-based, this application will run on any system that has a working Python environment in place, be it Windows, macOS, or Linux.

## 📌Technologies/Tools Used
 * Programming Language: * Python 3.7
 * GUI Framework: * Tkinter
 * HTTP Library: * Requests (for API calls)
 * Data Format: * JSON
 * API Service: * ExchangeRate-API

## 📌Instructions for Testing
Conduct the following tests to ensure that the application works as anticipated.

### 1.  *Standard Conversion Test:*
* Launch the app.
* In the Amount field, enter "100".
Select "INR" as the From currency and "USD" as the To currency.
* Click "Convert Now."

* Expected Output: The result of a calculation is shown at the end. Example: "Result: 1.2 USD"
### 2.  *Input Validation Test:*
* Launch the application.
* Type in any string or leave the Amount field blank.

* Click "Convert Now."
* Expected Output: A warning pop-up showing "Please enter a valid numeric amount" or "Please enter an amount."
### 3.  Offline/Network Error Test:
* Disconnect your computer from the internet. * Restart the application. * Expected Output: The app should print a "Network Error" error message but still open. * Try converting USD to EUR or to INR. It should work using the hardcoded fallback rates.
